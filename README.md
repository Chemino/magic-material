# magic-material

An integrated framework for materials property prediction and inverse design. This is a structured solution for one of the Physical Science Challenges of [ai4science hackathon](https://ai4science.io/), organized by [DeepVerse](deepverse.tech/en/), [Bota Bio](www.bota.bio), [Chemical.AI](https://chemical.ai/) and [Foreseen Biotechnology](www.foreseepharma.com/en-us).
